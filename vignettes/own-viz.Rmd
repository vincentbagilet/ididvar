This vignette **provides code that can easily be copied/pasted to make your own customized plots**, going beyond the quick but less customizable functions provided in the package.

This package exists to facilitate the computation and analysis of identifying variation weights. It therefore includes a set of functions to quickly visualize those weights. These functions have names starting by `idid_viz`. However, one may want to *customize* their graphs or build their own, hence this vignette. It does not use any viz function from `ididvar` (apart from the theming functions).

## Workflow to plot identifying variation weights

The workflow to make a plot from scratch is straightforward: 

1. Add a `weight` variable to the data set. Optionally, one can add a `contrib` dummy. For that we need to determine the contribution threshold. Here I use the `idid_contrib_threshold` to find a weight threshold below which removing observations does not change the point estimate or the standard error of the estimate of interest by more than a given proportion.
2. Compute the weights at a group level of interest (here state level) by summing weights of observations in this group.
3. Plot them

## Preparation

Let's assume we have already ran the regression of interest. We also add a `decade` variable and ISO codes from the `gapminder::country_codes` dataset that we are going to use later.  

```{r run_reg}
gapminder_sample <- gapminder |> 
  mutate(
    l_gdpPercap = log(gdpPercap),
    decade = year %/% 10 * 10
  ) |> 
  filter(continent %in% c("Africa", "Europe")) |>
  left_join(country_codes, by = join_by(country))

reg <- feols(
  data = gapminder_sample, 
  lifeExp ~ l_gdpPercap | country, 
  cluster = "country"
)
```


## Relationship between x and y

Before anything, one may want to visualize the weights as well as the relationship between the dependent variable and the independent variable of interest. 

### Partialed out relationship

```{r xy_rel, fig.asp=0.8}
data_partial <- 
  tibble(
    lifeExp_per = idid_partial_out(reg, "lifeExp", "l_gdpPercap"),
    l_gdpPercap_per = idid_partial_out(reg, "l_gdpPercap")
  ) 

data_partial |>
  ggplot(aes(x = l_gdpPercap_per, y = lifeExp_per)) +
  geom_point(size = 2, color = "#300D49") +
  geom_smooth(
    method = "lm", 
    formula = 'y ~ x',
    color = idid_colors_table[["complementary"]],
    fill = idid_colors_table[["complementary"]], 
    alpha = 0.1) +
  theme_idid() +
  labs(
    title = "Relationship between life expectancy and log GDP per capita",
    subtitle = "After partialling out country fixed effects",
    x = "Log GDP per capita (residualized)",
    y = "Life expectancy (residualized)"
  )
```

Such a mapping might be less legible when the sample size is large. In such instances, transparency, a bin or hex map or a bin-scatter can be useful tools to represent large numbers of observations.

### ididvar equivalent

```{r idid_viz_bivar, fig.asp=0.8}
idid_viz_bivar(reg, "l_gdpPercap")
```

To compute `data_partial` completely manually, one can do the following:

```{r data_partial_manual}
data_partial_manual <- 
  tibble(
    lifeExp_per = residuals(
      feols(gapminder_sample, lifeExp ~ 1 | country, cluster = "country")
    ),
    l_gdpPercap_per = residuals(
      feols(gapminder_sample, l_gdpPercap ~ 1 | country, cluster = "country")
    ),
    weight = (l_gdpPercap_per - mean(l_gdpPercap_per))^2
  ) |> 
  mutate(
    weight = weight/sum(weight),
    logweight = log10(weight * length(weight))
  )
```


## Cumulative weights

We first start by plotting the cumulative distribution of weights. We can add a `weight` variable to our dataset, along with a `contrib` dummy. 

```{r agg_weights, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE}
gapminder_weights <- gapminder_sample |> 
  mutate(
    weight = idid_weights(reg, "l_gdpPercap"),
    contrib = weight > idid_contrib_threshold(reg, "l_gdpPercap"),
    contrib_name = ifelse(contrib, 
                          "In the effective sample",
                          "Outside the effective sample")
  )
```

### Own cumulative graph

```{r cum_weights, fig.asp=1}
gapminder_weights |> 
  arrange(weight) |> 
  mutate(
    obs_id = row_number(),
    cum_weight = cumsum(weight)
  ) |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = obs_id, y = cum_weight)) + 
  geom_line(linewidth = 1.2, color = "#300D49") +
  geom_area(fill = "#300D49", alpha = 0.2) +
  theme_idid(aspect.ratio = 1) +
  labs(
    title = "Cumulative distribution of weights",
    x = "Observation index\n(smallest to largest weight)",
    y = "Cummulative sum of weights"
  )
```

### ididvar cumul equivalent

```{r idid_viz_cumul, fig.asp=1}
idid_viz_cumul(reg, "l_gdpPercap")
```

## Bar plots

Let's assume that we want to compare weights across countries. We compute our weight and mean contribution at that level.

```{r country_weights}
country_weights <- gapminder_weights |> 
  group_by(country, iso_alpha) |> 
  summarise(
    weight = sum(weight, na.rm = TRUE), 
    contrib = sum(contrib, na.rm = TRUE),
    .groups = "drop"
  )
```

We then make bar plots. For readibility and to produce a better graph, we order the states by weight.

### Own weight graph

```{r weight_bar_plot, echo=TRUE, fig.asp=1.3}
country_weights |> 
  mutate(country = forcats::fct_reorder(country, weight)) |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = weight, y = country)) + 
  geom_col(fill = "#300D49") +
  theme_idid() +
  labs(
    title = "Distribution of Identifying Variation Weights",
    x = "Weight",
    y = NULL
  ) 
```

### ididvar weight

```{r idid_weight_bar_plot, echo=TRUE, fig.asp=1.3}
idid_viz_weights(reg, "l_gdpPercap", var_y = country, order = "y")
```

### Own contrib graph

```{r contrib_bar_plot, echo=TRUE, fig.asp=1.3}
gapminder_weights |> 
  count(decade, contrib_name) |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = decade, y = n, fill = forcats::fct_rev(contrib_name))) + 
  geom_col() +
  coord_flip() +
  theme_idid() +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("#E79232", "#562A62")) +
  labs(
    title = "Set of observations contributing to identification",
    y = "Number of observations",
    x = NULL,
    fill = NULL
  ) 
```

### ididvar contrib

```{r idid_contrib_bar_plot, echo=TRUE, fig.asp=1.3, warning=FALSE}
idid_viz_contrib(reg, "l_gdpPercap", var_y = decade)
```

## Heatmaps

Let's assume that we now want to compare observations across years and decades. To do that, we build heatmaps and thus first aggregate data at the level we are interested in:

```{r country_decade_weights}
country_decade_weights <- gapminder_weights |> 
  group_by(country, decade, continent) |> 
  summarise(
    weight = sum(weight, na.rm = TRUE), 
    contrib = mean(contrib, na.rm = TRUE),
    .groups = "drop"
  ) 
```

We can then make the graphs we want.

### Weights with no scale

```{r heatmap_no_scale, echo=TRUE, fig.asp=1.5}
country_decade_weights |> 
  mutate(country = forcats::fct_reorder(country, weight, sum)) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = decade, y = country, fill = weight)) + 
  geom_tile() +
  theme_idid() +
  scale_fill_gradientn(colors = c("#C25807", "#FBE2C5", "#300D49")) +
  facet_grid(continent ~ ., scales = "free_y", space = "free_y") +
  theme(strip.text.y = element_text(angle = 0)) +
  labs(
    title = "Distribution of Identifying Variation Weights",
    x = "Weight",
    y = NULL
  ) 
```

The graph above was made plotting the raw weights. However, one value is much larger than the others. It hides all the variation in weight magnitude. This is why I introduce a specific scale that puts various observations in bins. On addition, by scaling weights with respect to an average weight, this scale allows to make graphs comparable between each other. 

### Weights with scale

```{r heatmap_with_scale, echo=TRUE, fig.asp=1.5}
country_decade_weights |> 
  mutate(weight_log = log10(weight * length(weight))) |> 
  # mutate(country = forcats::fct_reorder(country, weight, sum)) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = decade, y = country, fill = weight_log, z = weight_log)) + 
  geom_tile() +
  theme_idid() +
  # scale_fill_idid() +
  #what's behind scale_fill_idid()
  scale_fill_stepsn(
    colors = c("#C25807", "#FBE2C5", "#300D49"),
    breaks = log10(c(1/100, 1/50, 1/10, 1/2, 2, 10, 50, 100)),
    labels = c("0", "1/50x", "1/10x", "1/2x", "2x", "10x", "50x", "Inf"),
    limits = c(-2, 2),
    na.value = "gray88"
  ) +
  facet_grid(continent ~ ., scales = "free_y", space = "free_y") +
  theme(strip.text.y = element_text(angle = 0)) +
  labs(
    title = "Distribution of Identifying Variation Weights",
    fill = "Weight",
    x = NULL,
    y = NULL
  ) 
```

### ididvar weight equivalent

```{r idid_weight_heatmap, echo=TRUE, fig.asp=1.5}
idid_viz_weights(reg, "l_gdpPercap", var_y = country, var_x = decade) +
  facet_grid(continent ~ ., scales = "free_y", space = "free_y") +
  theme(strip.text.y = element_text(angle = 0)) +
  labs(
    title = "Distribution of Identifying Variation Weights",
    x = NULL,
    y = NULL
  ) 
```

### Contributing observations

```{r heatmap_contrib, echo=TRUE, fig.asp=1.5}
country_decade_weights |> 
  mutate(country = forcats::fct_reorder(country, contrib, sum)) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = decade, y = country, fill = contrib)) + 
  geom_tile() +
  theme_idid() +
  scale_fill_gradient(low = "#FBE2C5", high = "#300D49") +
  facet_grid(continent ~ ., scales = "free_y", space = "free_y") +
  theme(strip.text.y = element_text(angle = 0)) +
  labs(
    title = "Distribution of Identifying Variation Weights",
    x = NULL,
    y = NULL,
    fill = "Share of contributing observations"
  ) 
```

### Own contribution heatmap

```{r idid_contrib_heatmap, echo=TRUE, fig.asp=1.3, warning=FALSE}
idid_viz_contrib(reg, "l_gdpPercap", year, country, order = "y") +
  facet_grid(continent ~ ., scales = "free_y", space = "free_y") +
  labs(x = NULL, y = NULL)
```

## Maps

We then plot the data. To make a map, we need an `sf` object:

```{r world_sf}
world_sf <- rnaturalearth::ne_countries(scale = "medium", returnclass = "sf") |> 
  mutate(iso_alpha = adm0_a3) |> 
  filter(continent %in% c("Europe", "Africa")) |> 
  filter(iso_alpha != "RUS") 
```

We can then merge the data to the shape file and make the graphs of interest.

```{r map_weights, fig.asp=0.8}
data_sf <- world_sf |> 
  full_join(country_weights, by = join_by(iso_alpha)) |> 
  mutate(weight_log = log10(weight * length(weight))) 

data_sf |> 
  ggplot() +
  geom_sf(aes(fill = weight_log), color = "white", linewidth = 0.1) +
  theme_idid() +
  scale_fill_idid() +
  coord_sf(xlim = c(-20, NA)) +
  labs(
    title = "Distribution of Identifying Variation Weights",
    fill = "Weight, compared to the average weight"
  ) +
  theme(axis.text.y = element_blank(), 
        axis.text.x = element_blank())

data_sf |> 
  ggplot() +
  geom_sf(aes(fill = contrib), color = "white", linewidth = 0.1) +
  theme_idid() +
  coord_sf(xlim = c(-20, NA)) +
  scale_fill_gradient(low = "#FBE2C5", high = "#300D49", na.value = "gray88") +
  labs(
    title = "Distribution of contributing obs.",
    fill = "Number of contributing observations"
  ) +
  theme(axis.text.y = element_blank(), 
        axis.text.x = element_blank())
``` 

The maps produced in this document are not particularly instructive since the regression model is paritcularly naive.
