\title{Plot a map of identifying variation weights}
\usage{
idid_viz_weights_map(reg, var_interest, shape_file, join_by, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{reg}{A regression object.}

\item{var_interest}{A string. The name of the main variable of interest.}

\item{shape_file}{An \code{sf} object. The shape file to map the weights on.}

\item{join_by}{A character string. The name of the variable in the original
data and in \code{shape_file} and along which the matching should be performed.}

\item{...}{Additional elements to pass to the regression function when
partialling out controls.}
}
\value{
A ggplot object.
}
\description{
A short description...
displaying weights as fill color and scale for
each region, or nothing. If there are no overlapping polygons,
an error will occur, while if \code{...} is supplied (see below) it will
be passed onto the subsequent geom_sf(), otherwise a warning will be raised.
}
\examples{
reg <- state.x77 |>
  dplyr::as_tibble() |>
  dplyr::mutate(NAME = rownames(state.x77)) |>
  lm(formula = Illiteracy ~  Income + Population + `Life Exp` + Frost)

states_sf <- tigris::states(
    cb = TRUE, resolution = "20m", year = 2024, progress_bar = FALSE) |>
  tigris::shift_geometry()
