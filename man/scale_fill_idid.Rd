\title{Create a custom color scale for \code{ididvar} visualizations}
\usage{
scale_fill_idid(colors = c("#C25807", "#FBE2C5", "#300D49"), ...)

scale_color_idid(colors = c("#C25807", "#FBE2C5", "#300D49"), ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{colors}{A string vector of colors for the palette.
I recommend to pass a vector of 3 distinct colors, with a lighter color in
the middle, constituting a diverging scale. It allows a clear distinction
between contributing and non contributing observations.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments to be passed to the
\code{ggplot2::scale_fill_stepsn} or  \code{ggplot2::scale_color_stepsn}
function}
}
\description{
A function that makes a custom color scale and ensures that breaks in terms
of weight size (relative to the average) are consistent across users.

This scale has fixed limits and even if there are no very small or very
large weights, the scale remains the same and some color do not appear on
the graph (see the second example graph). Note that the labels of the scale
are specific to ididvar application and built with weights whose sum equals
1 in mind (and thus whose average is equal to 1/n_obs).
